Sesh 4 (18/4/2024 18:30 - idk):
working on the schmoovment

Sesh 5 (21/4/2024 9:00 - 21:00):
left and right movement - found out that the game actually doesn't need high runAccel/runDeccel because of the combat focus; without it the controls are gonna feel snappier and more responsive
added groundCheck using BoxRaycast, visualizing probably doesn't work, but I'll skip it since it's not needed for the game to work; may add it later (probably not)
reworked movement, now I have much more control over each part of movement
added jumps
added variable jump height depending on for how long the spacebar is held
added gravity increase/decrease method, increase when airborne && going downwards
added working coyote timer, yay!!!

Sesh 6 (22/4/24 19:00 - 21:00)
Added isJumping and isJumpFalling states
Added 2 variable gravity multipliers, applying them depending on if player is just falling or falling from a jump

Sesh 7 (1/5/24 14:15 - 19:00)
Learned how to do animations
Created character animation script, it could theoretically work for enemies as well
Added bunch of new movement states
Added idle animation, had to create a transition into idle state tho
Added run animation
Added multiple more animation clips, but they are not working yet :/

Sesh 8 (10/5/24 9:00 - 10:00)
Learning how to create an enemy AI
